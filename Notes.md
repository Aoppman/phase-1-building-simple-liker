Creating elements, adding them and editing the text within them

append() - can append mutliple elements as well as string to to document.
vs appendChild() - which can only append a single element to the document.

"createElement()" only creates the element but does not add it to the DOM - the newly created element then needs to be *appended to the DOM*
.. creating an element in JS does not automatically add it to the HTML

to set text to an element you can use ".innerText" or ".textContent"
